### config
You can save the config file with git engine credentials and use it instead of passing them as command line arguments.
The location of the config file is `~/.glmrl/config.yaml` by default, or you can specify it with `--config` flag.

example:
```yaml
gitlab:
  token: <gitlab-token>
  base_url: https://gitlab.com
```

## example
```
I can review only the MRs that:
- are open,
- have a label "to-review",
- are not approved by me,
- doesn't have enough approvals,
  - but I still want to see MRs with not enough approvals where I've been requested as a reviewer and didn't approve it,
- doesn't have my unresolved threads
  - but I still want to see MRs with my unresolved threads where my action is not the last (i.e. somebody replied in my thread and didn't resolve it).

When I press enter, I want to open the MR in my default browser.
```

command example:
```bash
glmrl list --action=open --state=open --labels.include='to-review' --approved-by-me=false --not-enough-approvals=true --without-my-unresolved-threads
```
